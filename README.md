# Alienwars 
----
 Alienwars is a CLI-RPG application of an alien invasion, you are expected to defend your planet at all cost.
 The good new is the aliens do not have weapons, the bad new is they out-number you and can inhabit your planet by mere landing on it.
 So Space Fighter, you have an obligation to defend or die.

####  The XP Factor

You will need to get XP faster inorder to level up, there fore you need to understand how points are calculated.
1. ``MOVES:`` you have a max of 2 moves to make a kill, anything more you lose the moves point
2. ``HITS:``  for every hit you make, you definitely get points, yeah basic stuff.
3. ``HEAD SHOTS:``  making a hit is one thing but can you hit the bullseye, an headshot is the center of the spaceship, hit that you get extra points
4. ``HIT TIME INTERVAL:`` how long from the start of the game or from your last hit did you make another hit, time is of the essence, 15sec to make a hit and you get an extra point.
